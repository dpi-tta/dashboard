# How to provide feedback

## Create an Issue

If you notice something that can be improved:

- First search [open and closed Issues](https://github.com/dpi-pttl/we-dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to make sure it hasn't already been discussed.
- If not, create a new issue.

## Providing review

When providing review on an in-progress feature:

- Use the Review App to explore the work-in-progress.
    - A link to the review app will appear in the Pull Request:

        ![](docs/images/view-deployment.png?raw=true)
    - Sign in with `alice@example.com`, `bob@example.com`, `carol@example.com`, or your own email address if you are one of [the seed users](https://github.com/dpi-pttl/we-dashboard/blob/main/db/seeds.rb#L9). Passwords on review apps are all `password`.
- Help the author by trying to find edge cases and bugs that they didn't think of.
- Screenshots and GIFs are worth a thousand words.
