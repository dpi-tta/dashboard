# How to contribute

## Setup

1. `bin/setup`
1. `rails s`

## Git flow

[Use this Git flow](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/developing/code-reviews) to make contributions.

1. Create an issue for work to be done (no matter how small)
2. Create a branch with that issue number, your initials, and a brief description (`1-ih-add-readme`)
3. Create a pull request in GitHub including "resolves"
4. Pushing the tip commit to main closes the PR and the Issue.

## Pull Request Review

The `.github/CODEOWNERS` file specifies who can approve pull requests. Please have a fellow technical associate review your pull request before getting final approval from @DPI-PTTL/tech-leads.

## Credentials

Get the `config/credentials/development.key` from the team lead.

### Show

`rails credentials:show --environment development`

### Edit

`EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit --environment development`

This will create `config/credentials/development.yml.enc` and `config/credentials/development.key` unless they already exist.

Same for `production` (just swap --environment)

## Sidekiq

Here's what you'll need to work with jobs in your development environment.

1. Install redis on your dev machine `brew install redis`
2. Now you can start redis server by running `redis-server`
3. Start sidekiq by running `bundle exec sidekiq`

You can access the sidekiq web ui at /sidekiq (if you have admin role)

## Subdomains

Add this to your `/etc/hosts` file so you can access subdomains in your dev environment.

```
127.0.0.1 news.dpi.local
127.0.0.1 dashboard.dpi.local
127.0.0.1 rfp.dpi.local
```

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

- if your browser is installed on Windows, the hosts file will be at `\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
- if your browser is installed on the Linux subsystem, `\etc\` is at the root of the Linux directory, but you may need to edit `\etc\wsl.conf` to ensure that changes to the `hosts` file will persist.

## PostgreSQL

1. Download PostgresApp Installer from [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html)
2. Install PostgresApp by dragging it to your Applications folder
3. Open PostgresApp and click "Initialize" to create a new PostgreSQL cluster
4. Download the Postico app from [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/v1.php)
5. Open Postico and connect to your PostgreSQL server by clicking "Connect" in the top left corner

_Note - Mac users may need to run this command before starting the PostgreSQL service:_

`gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/pg_config`

Some options for GUI PostgreSQL clients on Mac:

- [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/v1.php)

## Sample data

If you need sample data to work on your issue, run `rails dev:prime` after setting up the database.
If you run `rails dev:reprime`, make sure to remove `erd.png` from your commit before pushing.
